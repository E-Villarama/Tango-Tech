# Tango-Tech

[Work in Progress]

### Tango Finance App

A modern, modular financial management platform designed to streamline user onboarding, automate workflows, and deliver a clean, intuitive experience across web and mobile.

### Overview
The Tango Finance App is a multi-platform solution focused on delivering seamless financial services through a unified experience. The project will evolve into a full ecosystem that supports customer onboarding, account management, and real-time financial interactions — all powered by scalable, flexible components.

This repository serves as the starting point for the application. As the tech stack and architecture solidify (Next.js, Vue, Flutter, or hybrid), this README will expand to include technical documentation, setup instructions, and developer guidelines.


### Getting Started
This project is currently in early development. The setup steps below are provisional and will be updated as the architecture and tech stack are finalized.
At this stage, the repository focuses on structure, UX flows, and architectural direction rather than a fixed implementation.

#### Prequisites
- Node (LTS)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Git
  
[Specific requirements TBA]

### How to Run (Early Development)
(This section will change as features are added)

````bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tango-tech.git
cd tango-tech

# Install dependencies (once applicable)
npm install

# Run development server (example)
npm run dev

````

Once finalised this section will include
- Environment setup
- Local backend/API configuration
- Mobile build instructions
- Deployment previews

### Project Status

***STATUS:*** Under Development
- Architecture and stack selection in progress
- Core onboarding flows under design
- Backend integration pending
- Mobile implementation planned for a later phase 

### Core Objectives
- Build a user-friendly onboarding flow adaptable for both web and mobile
- Ensure UI/UX consistency across platforms regardless of implementation
- Establish a clean, modular codebase that supports future scaling
- Provide secure, reliable financial interactions and data flows
- Create reusable design elements and components for long-term maintainability
- Allow future integration with verification systems, admin dashboards, and automated workflows

### Key Features (Planned)

1. User Onboarding
- Multi-step registration process
- Document submission (ID, proofs, etc.)
- User verification workflow
- Clear progression indicators and error handling
- Platform-agnostic design (web + mobile)

2. User Dashboard (Future)
- At-a-glance financial summary
- Transactions overview
- Notifications & alerts

5. UI/UX System
- Shared design language for both web and mobile
- Reusable components
- Clean, frictionless interaction patterns

6. API & Data Layer
- Centralized service layer
- Secure communication with backend services
- Future-ready for scaling, caching, or microservices

### Project Structure
Project structure will evolve as the chosen tech stack is finalized. Planned layout will include:
- frontend/ – Web application (Next.js or Vue)
- mobile/ – Mobile app (Flutter or React Native)
- shared/ – Reusable logic, schemas, and components
- docs/ – Architecture, API specs, workflows, UI guidelines

### Roadmap
- Define final tech stack
- Build foundational UI components
- Create onboarding user flows
- Integrate backend API endpoints
- Develop dashboard + admin tools
- Testing, QA, and performance optimization
